/**

 * <li> advancing the state of the game with a specific action ({@link StateObservation#advance(ACTIONS, Random)}),
 * <li> copying the current state
 * <li> signaling end, score and winner of the game
 * </ul>
 * See class {@link C4Base} for details of state coding.
 *
 * Note: If a state is a win (draw) can only be detected when this state was formed via advance. This is because
 * only when an action is made (via advance) then it is detected whether the piece set by this action generates a
 * 4-in-a-row or whether it completes the board (without any 4-in-a-row) and thus is a draw. It is assumed that
 * the pre-advance state was not a game-over state.
